Comments are non-executable lines of code used for documentation purposes. In HTML, comments are enclosed within <!-- and --> tags and are not displayed on the webpage. They're helpful for developers to annotate their code, provide explanations, or temporarily disable certain sections without affecting the webpage's functionality. 
Single Line Comments-
Single line comments are used to annotate a single line of code. In HTML, single line comments are enclosed within <!-- and --> tags.
Multi-line Comments-
Multi-line comments are used to annotate multiple lines of code. In HTML, multi-line comments are also enclosed within <!-- and --> tags, but they can span across multiple lines. They're useful for longer explanations, comments that span multiple lines of code, or for temporarily disabling large sections of code.
Example - 
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <p>This paragraph contains some text.</p>
    
    <!-- 
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It can span multiple lines.
    -->
</body>
